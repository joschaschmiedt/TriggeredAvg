# Triggered Average Plugin for OpenEphys GUI

A work-in-progress plugin for the Open Ephys GUI that averages continuous
signals triggered by TTL events and/or messages, similar to a triggered display on an oscilloscope.
The plugin is based on the [Online PSTH plugin](https://github.com/open-ephys-plugins/online-psth).

## Features

- **Multi-trigger Support**: Responds to TTL lines, broadcast messages, or combined TTL+message triggers
- **Flexible Time Windows**: Configurable pre-trigger (-500ms to -10ms) and post-trigger (10ms to 5000ms) windows
- **Channel Selection**: Display all channels or select specific channels for visualization
- **Multiple Display Modes**: Individual traces, averaged traces, overlay mode, or both
